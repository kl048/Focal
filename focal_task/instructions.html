            <b>Instructions</b>
        </p>
    Welcome! You are being given US$7.00 for participating in this study. This is an experiment on market decision-making. Pay close attention to the instructions. A good understanding of the instructions and well-thought-out decisions during the experiment can earn you a considerable amount of money beyond the US$7.00 starting amount.
    <p>
        <p>
    In this experiment, you are one of two firms in a market. You must decide the price at which to sell units of a fictitious commodity. The experiment is split into two halves, each consisting of 25 periods of trade. After the first 30 periods, we will change the market conditions. We will inform you in detail about these changes after the first 30 periods are over.
</p>
</p>
    <p>
        During the 50 periods the other firm in your market is always the same participant. That is, though there are a number of participants in the room, you and the same other firm serve your market for the entire course of the experiment. The other participants serve other markets.
    </p>
        Note well: During the experiment, you will play the role of Firm A or Firm B.
    <p>
    The trade of the commodity determines your profit in “ECUs.” After the experiment, your payment in dollars will be computed and you will be paid immediately in cash. You will get $1 for every 140 Points you earned. In what follows, we explain how sales in the market are made and how your profit is computed. After we read the instructions, you will have the opportunity to ask questions. Before we start with the actual experiment, we will ask you a few questions to review these instructions and ensure everybody has fully understood them. Then we will begin the first trading period.

        <b>How sales are done:</b>
     </p>
    <p>
    In every period, you and the other seller in the market choose a price at which to sell units of the commodity. Note that this is the price per unit. While you may sell more than one unit, you can post only one price. That is, you cannot sell different units at different prices. Prices must be integers. The number of units you offer is automatically chosen by the computer in a way that ensures that you do not lose money by selling at a price below your production cost.
    </p>

        <b>How purchases are done:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
    No buyers participate in this experiment. Instead, buyers are simulated by the computer.
        </p>

    <b>Profit:</b>
        </p>
    <p>

        For every unit you sell, you earn the difference between your price and production cost for that unit. Profit in each period is the sum of these earnings. Note that you do not learn how many units you sell, nor the production cost per unit, but you do learn the resultant profit.
    </p>
    <p>

        <b>Profit tables:</b>
        <p>
We also have provided two profit tables on paper. The tables show how your profit for a period relates to both your price choice and the price choice of the other seller. These tables provide the same information as the calculator.
</p>
    <p>
    First look at the long printout titled “FULL PROFIT TABLE.” As you can see, your price choices of 21 and above are shown on the left edge of the table from top to bottom. The other seller’s price choices of 21 and above are shown on the top of the table from left to right. Each cell of the table shows profits for the particular combination of prices. Your profit is the first number in the cell. The other seller’s profit is the second number after the comma.
</p>
   <p>
        Now look at the printout titled “SUMMARY PROFIT TABLES.” The top table shows that if you choose a price of 21 or below, your profit does not depend on the other seller’s price choice. The second-from-the-top table shows that if the other seller chooses a price of 21 or below, his or her profit does not depend on your price choice. The third large table summarizes the information in the “FULL PROFIT TABLE” printout.
    </p>

       <b>Feedback:</b>
        </p>
    <p>
At the end of each period, you will see a screen informing you about the price you charged and your resulting profit. You also will see this same information for the other seller. In addition, at the bottom of all screens you will see prices and profits from all previous periods.
